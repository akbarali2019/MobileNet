# MobileNet
MobileNet Image Classification With TensorFlow's Keras API

MobileNets are a class of small, low-latency, low-power models that can be used for classification, detection, and other common tasks convolutional neural networks are good for. Because of their small size, these are considered great deep learning models to be used on mobile devices.
